# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
 A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a local congressional election using data analytics tools such as Python, Visual Studio Code, and Git
 
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes for each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Results

There were 369,711 votes cast in the election. Out of which Jefferson accounted 10.5% of votes (38,855 votes in total), whereas Denver was the largest county accounting for 82.8% of votes(306,055 total votes), and Arapahoe produced remaining 6.7% of votes (total 24,801 votes)

The winner of the election was:

## Summary
The analysis os the election show that:
Using Python and CSV election data the model analysed total of 369,711 votes, in three different counties. The similar model can be used for other counties across the country, which will save the public's money and time, as he process is very efficient. Additionally, as the results are tabulated by python script, their is very less chance of any irreguarily with he results, as output of the code can be audited and changed if required.
